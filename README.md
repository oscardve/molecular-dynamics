Some representative scripts and codes which I wrote for the purposes of: building structures, generating input files for MD simulations, and analyzing MD output files (e.g. atomic trajectories and log files).

These scripts were also published in my final thesis at the following website:

Regarding the TCL-Tk scripts, I found the following references helpful:

The following reference was helpful for writing the Linux scripts:
W.E. Shotts. The Linux Command Line: A Complete Introduction. No Starch Press Series. No Starch Press, 2012.

The following reference was helpful for writing the C++ codes:
B. Stroustrup. Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++. Addison-Wesley, 2014.
