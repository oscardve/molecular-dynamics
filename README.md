Some representative scripts and codes which I wrote for the purposes of: building structures, generating input files for MD simulations, and analyzing MD output files (e.g. atomic trajectories and log files).

These scripts were also published in my final thesis at the following website:

Regarding the TCL-Tk scripts, I found the following references helpful:

The following reference was helpful for writing the Linux scripts:
W.E. Shotts. The Linux Command Line: A Complete Introduction. No Starch Press Series. No Starch Press, 2012.

The following reference was helpful for writing the C++ codes:
B. Stroustrup. Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++. Addison-Wesley, 2014.

Regarding the scripts employed for the computation of the Binding free energy:
* If using the method of geometrical transformations, have a look at this tutorial:

* If using the method of Hybrid Steered Molecular Dynamics, please contact my PhD advisor Dr. Liao Chen:
